- The highest coefficient is Outlet_Type_SuperMarket Type 3. Our data was not scaled, so this shows that if the outlet type matches this, it increases sales by an average of $1984.76. 
- The second highest coefficient is Outlet_Size_High. This shows that if that is the outlet size, sales were increased by an average of $495.82
- The third highest coefficient is Outlet_Type_SuperMarket Type 2. This had a negative correlation. If this is the outlet type the sales were decreased by an average of $402.58.
